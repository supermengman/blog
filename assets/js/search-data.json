Blue Nick and Rohan . Gray-scaling is a bit more complicated. There are multiple methods that, in theory, should work. According to one website I found, there are two methods: average or weighted. Average is as simple as it seems - just take the average of all three values: . Grayscale = (R + G + B) / 3 . However, due to the way that humans perceive light (with different sensitivities for different colors), this isn&#39;t the most accurate. This leads to the weighted method, based on the way humans actually weigh different colors of light in their vision:&gt; Grayscale = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B . note from andrew: humans see green the best, so that is why green is the highest. The weights make sense. | . I got the information on grayscaling from here, so click that link to learn more about it. . Since the weighted method is more efficient, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll be using here. Actually implementing it was pretty difficult though. Instead of using the numeric RGB values, I had to calculate the luminance in order to make everything work. . note from andrew: I found the research for these values, so I assume that calculating luminance requires knowing the gamma, which is assumed to be 2.2 in this case. | . public class GrayConversion extends ImageBlueprint { public GrayConversion(String name, String ext) { super(name, ext); this.colorFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;Gray&quot; + &quot;.png&quot;; } public GrayConversion(String name) { super(name); this.colorFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;Gray&quot; + &quot;.png&quot;; } @Override protected void conversion() { BufferedImage img = null; PrintWriter colorPrt = null; FileWriter colorWrt = null; // Just deletes file if already exists in tmp try { File file = new File(this.colorFile); Files.deleteIfExists(file.toPath()); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(&quot;Delete File error: &quot; + e); } // try { // colorPrt = new PrintWriter(colorWrt = new FileWriter(this.colorFile, true)); // } catch (IOException e) { // // TODO Auto-generated catch block // e.printStackTrace(); // } try { img = ImageIO.read(new File(this.inFile)); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } for (int i = 0; i &lt; this.height; i++) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; this.width; j++) { //Color col = new Color(img.getRGB(j, i)); //int rgb = new Color((int)(0.299 * col.getRed()), (int)(0.114 * col.getGreen()), (int)(0.587 * col.getBlue())).getRGB(); int rgb = img.getRGB(j, i); int r = (rgb &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xFF; int g = (rgb &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xFF; int b = (rgb &amp; 0xFF); // Normalize and gamma correct: float rr = (float) Math.pow(r / 255.0, 2.2); float gg = (float) Math.pow(g / 255.0, 2.2); float bb = (float) Math.pow(b / 255.0, 2.2); // Calculate luminance: float lum = (float) (0.2126 * rr + 0.7152 * gg + 0.0722 * bb); // Gamma compand and rescale to byte range: int grayLevel = (int) (255.0 * Math.pow(lum, 1.0 / 2.2)); int gray = (grayLevel &lt;&lt; 16) + (grayLevel &lt;&lt; 8) + grayLevel; img.setRGB(j, i, gray); } } // System.out.println(&quot;for loop done&quot;); try { ImageIO.write(img, &quot;png&quot;, new File(this.colorFile) ); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } } public static void main(String[] args) { GrayConversion nicandrohan = new GrayConversion(&quot;nicandrohan&quot;, &quot;png&quot;); nicandrohan.conversion(); } } . Gray Nick and Rohan . ASCII Hell . Finally, I&#39;m going to convert images to ASCII characters. The problem with the old method was that it stretched the image out too much and didn&#39;t look good at all. I found that the best solution would be to take 4 rows and 2 columns of pixels and convert them into a single ASCII character, so that&#39;s what I implemented here. . Also, as a side note, I basically just copied the previous code and edited that. No point in reinventing the wheel once you already get what&#39;s happening. . Additionally, (I didn&#39;t have to, but) I tried to fix the ASCII characters to be more evenly spaced out. I decided to use the link provided and found a chart of 94 characters organized by those that took the most dark space to those that took the least. . Now here&#39;s the fun math part. I wanted to get a mostly divisible number but 94 only factors into 47 and 2, so I rounded to 90 and decided to take 15 of those ASCII characters to use. Then, I took every 6th character in the character list to get my values. Next, I derived an equation to get the thresholds. Since the max value of RGB is 255 and the max percentage of coverage is 23.1%, I got t = (1 - 1/0.23) * 255 to find the thresholds. Finally, I compared each character and plugged its respective coverage percent into the equation to get every threshold. . As for the results, they went a bit differently than how I expected. I&#39;m not going to show them here, but they&#39;re a lot more detailed than the original ASCII calculator. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think it looks super good with smaller images, so I decided to keep the old conversion. . public class ASCIIConversion extends ImageBlueprint { public ASCIIConversion(String name, String ext) { super(name, ext); this.colorFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;ASCII&quot; + &quot;.txt&quot;; } public ASCIIConversion(String name) { super(name); this.colorFile = this.outDir + name + &quot;ASCII&quot; + &quot;.txt&quot;; } @Override protected void conversion() { // Controls how big chunks are taken for ASCII characters final int XLENGTH = 1; final int YLENGTH = 2; BufferedImage img = null; PrintWriter asciiPrt = null; FileWriter asciiWrt = null; Color col = null; try { File file = new File(this.colorFile); Files.deleteIfExists(file.toPath()); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(&quot;Delete File error: &quot; + e); } try { asciiPrt = new PrintWriter(asciiWrt = new FileWriter(this.colorFile, true)); } catch (IOException e) { System.out.println(&quot;ASCII out file create error: &quot; + e); } try { img = ImageIO.read(new File(this.inFile)); } catch (IOException e) { } for (int i = 0; i &lt; img.getHeight(); i += 4) { for (int j = 0; j &lt; img.getWidth(); j += 2) { // colorSum stores total sum of RGB values, counter keeps track of how many are being counted // colorSum/counter = average // average is taken to get ASCII character double colorSum = 0; int counter = 0; for (int k = 0; k &lt; XLENGTH; k++) { for (int l = 0; l &lt; YLENGTH; l++) { if (k &lt; img.getWidth() &amp;&amp; l &lt; img.getHeight()) { counter++; col = new Color(img.getRGB(j + k, i + l)); colorSum += (((col.getRed() * 0.30) + (col.getBlue() * 0.59) + (col .getGreen() * 0.11))); } } } double average = colorSum / counter; try { asciiPrt.print(asciiChar(average)); asciiPrt.flush(); asciiWrt.flush(); } catch (Exception ex) { } } try { asciiPrt.println(&quot;&quot;); asciiPrt.flush(); asciiWrt.flush(); } catch (Exception ex) { } } } // conversion table, there may be better out there ie https://www.billmongan.com/Ursinus-CS173-Fall2020/Labs/ASCIIArt public String asciiChar(double g) { String str = &quot; &quot;; // Higher quality, looks better with bigger images // if (g &gt;= 224.6) { // str = &quot; &quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 186.6) { // str = &quot;-&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 165.5) { // str = &quot;;&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 143) { // str = &quot;(&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 137.5) { // str = &quot;&lt;&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 127.5) { // str = &quot;L&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 123.1) { // str = &quot;1&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 113.1) { // str = &quot;n&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 102) { // str = &quot;s&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 85.4) { // str = &quot;h&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 75.4) { // str = &quot;4&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 69.8) { // str = &quot;e&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 62.1) { // str = &quot;5&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 51) { // str = &quot;D&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 35.5) { // str = &quot;Q&quot;; // } else if (g &gt;= 17.8) { // str = &quot;M&quot;; // } else { // str = &quot;@&quot;; // } if (g &gt;= 240) { str = &quot; &quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 210) { str = &quot;.&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 190) { str = &quot;*&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 170) { str = &quot;+&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 120) { str = &quot;^&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 110) { str = &quot;&amp;&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 80) { str = &quot;8&quot;; } else if (g &gt;= 60) { str = &quot;#&quot;; } else { str = &quot;@&quot;; } return str; } public static void main(String[] args) { ASCIIConversion nicandrohan = new ASCIIConversion(&quot;nicandrohan&quot;, &quot;png&quot;); nicandrohan.conversion(); } } .

Backend implementation on Spring boot: . As seen, I set up the code such that I could get (curl) a site on my local spring boot, returning the data about weather. I was about to implement this into displaying with javascript, but as of now the AWS servers are down so the links are not working yet. If it does get fixed, it will be seen here. . The source code can be seen here, but here is a snippet of the code that i changed: . public ResponseEntity&lt;JSONObject&gt; getCovid() { //calls API once a day, sets body and status properties Long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis()/(1000*60); if (last_run == null || (currentTime - last_run)&gt;5) { try { //APIs can fail (ie Internet or Service down) //RapidAPI header HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder() .uri(URI.create(&quot;https://weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com/current.json?q=209.66.205.197&quot;)) .header(&quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;, &quot;0fb4bb4059msh8489d467f79e14ep1d57f9jsnd0d67fb163e6&quot;) .header(&quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;, &quot;weatherapi-com.p.rapidapi.com&quot;) .method(&quot;GET&quot;, HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.noBody()) .build(); //RapidAPI request and response HttpResponse&lt;String&gt; response = HttpClient.newHttpClient().send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString()); //JSONParser extracts text body and parses to JSONObject this.body = (JSONObject) new JSONParser().parse(response.body()); this.status = HttpStatus.OK; //200 success this.last_run = currentTime; } catch (Exception e) { //capture failure info HashMap&lt;String, String&gt; status = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); status.put(&quot;status&quot;, &quot;RapidApi failure: &quot; + e); //Setup object for error this.body = (JSONObject) status; this.status = HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR; //500 error this.last_run = null; } } . Instead of getting the date, I get the epoch time and convert it to minutes. When I pull from the API, if it is successfull, I set the time that I ran the API to the last_run. So, if the difference between the two runs is greater than 5 minutes, then it will request the API again. As this is weather, I think 5 minutes is adequate time, and also enough to take advantage of my 1 million requests per month. . Questions? . Benefit of using an API? | An API allows code to interact with data from a server, and this is necessary especailly for our development environment, which is deploying a website. We will constantly have to interact with web servers and possibly serve our own data, so an API is necessary to make it easy to access data without having to write a lot of code. It provides a template for easier interaction in the future. . Benefits of backend implementation? | As described above, if it was only frontend, the code would have to request the source api every time a user reloads, which could be wasteful if the API hasn&#39;t had any meaningful changes or updates to its data. So, mine limits requests to every 5 minutes to the source server, caching and saving the last run. This cuts down on unnecessary cost, which could be a problem when scaled up. .",

            "content": "Idea: Science Olympiad Website . As many of our members are in Science Olympiad (4/8 of them), and we have friends in different classes, we decided to combine two teams to make one large group. Our idea was to make a Science Olympiad website, being able to create a database of current and past science olympiad members and assigning them to competitions. . Features (Wire Frame, Concept) . Overall, the design should include a navigation bar, with dropdown menus for things like events, rosters, and instructors. The events page should have a brief overview of each event, and perhaps a link can be put in each one for another page with further information. . For the rosters, it should just be displaying the database, maybe with javascript styling and data management as seen in this weeks javascript learning. . As for events, there should be multiple areas for things like a calendar API, so others can request information on when a certain event or where it is. . A core feature would be the need for accounts. These accounts would have information logged directly into the rosters, and should update if they choose to update their information inside a profile tab. There should also be an option to choose desired events and add those categories into the roster. . Another feature would be the creation of groups for events, where information of the group will be shared to all members of the group to allow them to find contact information quickly and easily. It would make organization easier than trying to interpret a google sheets. . Modeling/UML . . This is a diagram for how the data will be transferred between users and the website for logging in. Inside CurrentUser will be attributes like school, grade, and events, which would get updated regularly into the database. . In addition, instructors should have more features in an admin area that is only accessible to them. There should be a database to check if the user is an instructor, and allow access to admin. This admin area will have areas to set groups and delete users or change data as well in the database. .",

Most of the data structure is similar to the person code in Mr Morts javascript, but they are class definitions instead of functions. This makes it easier to read and see within the funciton itself. . &lt;/div&gt; . .",

4181] time taken = 74.7499 ms all values are equal: 4181 . Break It Down! . For . // extending for FOR class FiboFor extends Fibo { // constructor public FiboFor() { super(); } // constructor with input public FiboFor(int n) { super(n); } // overrides init for FOR @Override protected void init() { super.name = &quot;for&quot;; // initializes variables for first 2 terms int previousTerm = 0, currentTerm = 1; for (int i = 1; i &lt;= super.size; i++) { // in essence same code as while, but more concise super.setData(previousTerm); int nextTerm = previousTerm + currentTerm; // shift the terms up one in sequence previousTerm = currentTerm; currentTerm = nextTerm; } } } . Skill 1.B . In essence, the for overrides the init function. It then implements a for loop, which adds the previous 2 terms as many times as the nth number of the fibonacci sequence, then stops. It uses the super to call the parent constructor, as well as set values for the name. It also calls super.setData using the super. . While . // extending for WHILE class FiboWhile extends Fibo { // calls super constructor default public FiboWhile() { super(); } // constructor with input public FiboWhile(int n) { super(n); } @Override // override old init protected void init() { super.name = &quot;while&quot;; //name // initializes variables for first terms of fibo int previousTerm = 0, currentTerm = 1; // initiate variable for while loop int i = 1; while (i &lt;= super.size) { // setData as the previous term super.setData(previousTerm); // nextTerm is the previous 2 terms added int nextTerm = previousTerm + currentTerm; // update the two old terms to move one up the fibo sequence previousTerm = currentTerm; currentTerm = nextTerm; // repeat i++; } } } . Skill 1.B . Almost the same thing as the for loop, except the variable of i is defined outside the loop. It also uses super. It&#39;s slightly slower, possibly due to the initialization of the variable out of the iteration. . Recursion . class FiboRecursion extends Fibo { // default constructor public FiboRecursion() { super(); } // takes input of number, calls constructor public FiboRecursion(int n) { super(n); } // the recursive function: type int so it feeds into self and returns a value public int fibNum(int n) { // if its the first 2 terms (0 or 1), set the data in the array and hashmap as 0 or 1 and return if (n &lt;= 1) { this.setDataRec(n, n); // setData as 0 or 1 return n; } int currentFibNum = fibNum(n-1) + fibNum(n-2); // sets the current fibonacci number to the sum of the previous two (recursion starts) this.setDataRec(n, currentFibNum); // sets data of the currentFibNum to the index of the fibNum (n) return currentFibNum; // returns for recursion } @Override // overwrite init function for the RECURSION protected void init() { // set name super.name = &quot;recursion&quot;; // populate array for (int i = 0; i &lt; super.size; i++) { super.list.add((long) 0); super.hash.put(i, super.list.clone()); } // find the fib num up to super.size minus 1 because does not include fibNum(super.size - 1); } // better setdata: can put into specific index public void setDataRec(int n, long num) { super.list.set(n, num); // sets something into the array at certain index ArrayList&lt;Long&gt; smallList = new ArrayList&lt;Long&gt;(super.list.subList(0,n+1)); // cuts off the list at the fibonacci number length, as it already populates with the amount needed super.hash.put(n, smallList.clone()); // adds the list to hashmap } } . Skill 1.B . This one was the most intensive, especially as adding data into the predefined ArrayList and HashMap proved to be quite difficult. In specific, the recursion required things to be added into the array out of order, so I could not rely on the setData method. However, I could also not just add data into any index in the ArrayList, because I couldn&#39;t add data into an empty Array, only add or append to it. So, I had to first loop through how many fibonacci numbers were going to get calculated and add placeholder values to both the ArrayList and the HashMap. Then, I had to create a new method to set the data into a specific index, as seen above. It has to truncate the ArrayList as the placeholder values stay beyond the Fibonacci value calculated. . The recursion itself wasn&#39;t that complicated: if it was either 1 or 0, it would just return 1 and 0 to the respective fibonacci number. When you call a specific number, it sets the fibonacci number for the previous two added together, which calls it again and recurses upon itself. . Skill 5.A . Recursion is much slower, though, as all these function calls cannot complete until it recurses onto the 0th Fibonacci number, then executing back all the way up the heap. This extreme use of memory, as well as having to call the function twice every time it runs, leads to slower execution than iteration. This is seen by the time taken increasing as well. . Check if all are equal . // inspiration from https://stackoverflow.com/a/5503239 public static boolean areSame(long value, long... values) { for (long i: values) if(value != i) return false; return true; } . Skill 4.C . This code takes one value to check against, then a list of other values to check if they are all the same. This took inspiration from a stackexchange answer. A variable takes on the value of all the rest of the values, and an if statement checks if those values are equal to the original. If it is, it will return true, and in my program it tells you that it is true. .",

            "content": "Q1. 2019 AP CSA FRQ . The APCalendar class contains methods used to calculate information about a calendar. You will write two methods of the class. . public class APCalendar { /** Returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise */ private static boolean isLeapyear(int year) { /* implementation not shown */} /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 * */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) { /* to be implemented in part (a) */} /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, * where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. */ private static int firstDayOfYear(int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. * * Returns 1 for January 1 (month = 1, day = 1) of any year. * * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. * */ private static int dayOfYear(int month, int day, int year) { /* implementation not shown */ } /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. * * */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { /* to be implemented in part (b) */} // there may be instance variables, constructors, and other methods not shown. } . (a) numberOfLeapYears . Write the static method numberOfLeapYears, which returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. . In order to calculate this value, a helper method is provided for you. . isLeapYear(year) returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise | . Complete method numberOfLeapYears below. You must use isLeapYear appropriately to receive full credit. . /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 * */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) { int leapYearCount = 0; // variable to keep track of amount of leap years // for loop: set year to year1, and while it is not yet at year2, find out if leapyear or not for(int year = year1; year &lt;= year2; year++) { // check the year for if it is leap year if(isLeapYear(year)) { leapYearCount++; // increase count } } return leapYearCount; // return the integer for the count of leap years } . The approach I took was to make a loop to go through all the years between the two years, and check if it was a leap year. If it was, it would add one to the count of the leap year. As seen above, this is that pseudocode written in actual java. Comparing to the solution code, it is almost identitcal (with the variable names as the exception). . (b) dayOfWeek . Write the static method dayOfWeek, which returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, 2019 began on a Tuesday, and January 5 is the fifth day of 2019. As a result, January 5, 2019, fell on a Saturday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 5, 2019) returns 6. . As another example, January 10 is the tenth day of 2019. As a result, January 10, 2019, fell on a Thursday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 10, 2019) returns 4. . In order to calculate this value, two helper methods are provided for you. . firstDayOfYear(year) returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, since 2019 began on a Tuesday, firstDayOfYear(2019) returns 2. | dayOfYear(month, day, year) returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. For the first day of the year, January 1 (month = 1, day = 1), the value 1 is returned. This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example, dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year, while dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year. | . Complete method dayOfWeek below. You must use firstDayOfYear and dayOfYear appropriately to receive full credit. . /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. * * */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { firstDay = firstDayOfYear(year); // store the day of the week of the first day dayAfterNew = dayOfYear(month, day, year); // store the number of days since new year (inclusive) return (firstDay + dayAfterNew - 1) % 7; // adds the day of the week to the days since new year, but minus 1 because the dayAfterNew includes the first day. then, mod 7 } . For this one, I initially began by trying to make a loop, and adding each day to the number of the firstDay day by day. I soon realized that was not the intended solution. . Instead, I set variables for the firstDay day of the week, and the days after the new year as dayAfterNew. Then, I returned the value of them added minus 1 to get some number, and modulus 7 to take the modulus (remainder). The remainder would be the day of the week, which is what is returned . Comparing to the answer, I see that the solution has the return value stored within another variable, so it is almost identitical. .",

Reflecting on “Psychology and the Good Life” . One thing I really took away from the video is that our minds always lie to us about happiness. Sometimes, we think that we want so much more money than we need, when in the end it doesn’t satisfy our needs. We might think that making more connections, getting good grades will fulfill something in us, but that just isn’t the case all the time. . Laurie Santos gives really good points on how to be happier, one of which was to spend more time reaching out to the people that you want to maintain social connections too. Developing from this, thanking those who really helped you and showing gratitude is another way. I don’t feel as though I do that enough for people that I take help from for granted, especially from my mom and dad. . Moving away from social, savoring moments in our life will also add to our happiness. Instead of having an outsider perspective on our life, actually living in it and applying ourselves will make us happier. I think I also need to work on this. . Reflecting overall on the video, I realize that I need to take action for my own happiness. Often, I find myself offputting things that I want or need to do, even though I know I will be happier if I do them. Lack of motivation is still in my hands, so here are some goals that I want to strive towards: . limit the time I spend procrastinating on assignments to be happier at the end of the day | use my phone less when talking to friends | be grateful in my current position in life | thank my parents more often | reach out more to my friends instead of being the one being reached out to | .",

            "content": "If Statements . If . If is a conditional statement, meaning it will only execute code within the block if the statement is true. If the code executed within the condition returns true, then code will run. This code in the conditional can be very complex, or could even be a whole method call. It just needs to return true or false. . import java.util.Scanner; public class cheese { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner yesNoScan = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner initiate String yesNo = yesNoScan.nextLine(); System.out.println(yesNo); // if statement: if matches yes, then say yes if (yesNo.matches(&quot;yes&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;yes!&quot;); } } } cheese.main(null); . yes yes! . As seen in this example, the program calls for user input. If the user inputs yes, the condition returns true, and the code block runs. The console will say &quot;yes!&quot; . If-else . If-else builds off of an if statement, but adds the else part. If the condition in the if statement is false, then the code in the else block will execute instead. The else does not have a conditional. . import java.util.Scanner; public class cheese { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner yesNoScan = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner initiate String yesNo = yesNoScan.nextLine(); System.out.println(yesNo); // if statement: if matches yes, then say yes if (yesNo.matches(&quot;yes&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;yes!&quot;); } else { // if not yes, then print that System.out.println(&quot;not yes :(&quot;); } } } cheese.main(null); . nope not yes :( . As seen, when an input that isn&#39;t yes is entered, the &quot;not yes :(&quot; is triggered to run. . If-elseif-else . This code structure combines both if and else statements. If the first conditional under the if statement returns false, then it goes to the next part: else if. The else if does have a conditional, basically a second conditional to check if the first one is false. If that one is true, it will run the code, but if not, it goes to the next block. There can be an indefinite chain of elseifs, but they always run from top to bottom and the statement exits if one of them is true. If they all return false, the else statement at the end will execute the code if everything is false. . import java.util.Scanner; public class cheese { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner yesNoScan = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner initiate String yesNo = yesNoScan.nextLine(); System.out.println(yesNo); // if statement: if matches yes, then say yes if (yesNo.matches(&quot;yes&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;yes!&quot;); } else if (yesNo.matches(&quot;no&quot;)) { // if no, then print System.out.println(&quot;no? :(&quot;); } else { // if not yes or no System.out.println(&quot;bruh u messed up&quot;); } } } cheese.main(null); . fdasdfagsa bruh u messed up . As seen above, when it is neither yes or no, it outpus the else block of code. . Switch Case . Sometimes, when you only need to test expressions matching only a single integer, value, or String, a Switch Case is the better option. It is similar to an if-elseif-elseif...-else chain, except it has less functionality. . In an if-elseif chain, each section has its own conditional. These conditionals can be extremely complex and do not have to relate to each other at all. However, in a switch case, the switch takes in an input, and then checks against the &quot;cases&quot;. Basically, the conditionals in all of the cases are only determining whether the input matches the set case. . For example, to match a string in if-elseif, it would look something like: . import java.util.Scanner; public class cheesePicker { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Type a type of cheese, and find out the best meat to pair it with: &quot;); Scanner cheeseScan = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner initiate String cheese = cheeseScan.nextLine(); System.out.println(cheese); // if statement: if matches types of cheese, say the sandwich if (cheese.matches(&quot;gouda&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;salami&quot;); } else if (cheese.matches(&quot;parmesan&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;prosciutto&quot;); } else if (cheese.matches(&quot;havarti&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;soppressata&quot;); } else if (cheese.matches(&quot;monterey jack&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;salami&quot;); } else if (cheese.matches(&quot;ricotta&quot;)) { System.out.println(&quot;ground beef&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;search it up&quot;); } } } cheesePicker.main(null); . Type a type of cheese, and find out the best meat to pair it with: gouda salami . However, by using switch case, these conditionals can be made more readable as they are just matching strings: . import java.util.Scanner; public class cheesePickerCase { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Type a type of cheese, and find out the best meat to pair it with: &quot;); Scanner cheeseScan = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner initiate String cheese = cheeseScan.nextLine(); System.out.println(cheese); // switch case: take cheese as input, check against list of cheeses switch (cheese) { case &quot;gouda&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;salami&quot;); break; // break to get out of switch, so no default case case &quot;parmesan&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;prosciutto&quot;); break; case &quot;havarti&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;soppressata&quot;); break; case &quot;monterey jack&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;salami&quot;); break; case &quot;ricotta&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;ground beef&quot;); break; default: // case if nothing matches System.out.println(&quot;google it&quot;); } } } cheesePickerCase.main(null); . Type a type of cheese, and find out the best meat to pair it with: monterey jack salami . De Morgan&#39;s Law . These are laws named after Augustus De Morgan, a 19th C British Mathemetician. It uses the NOT operator, which takes precedent over AND and OR. It can be used to simplify expressions of true and false, and as boolean values are being compared in an if conditional, applying De Morgan&#39;s law to simplify a program&#39;s logic will be very helpful. . Overall, the idea is that: when distributing or factoring a negation from a boolean expression, the operators all switch. || changes to &amp;&amp; and vice versa. In addition, &lt; changes to =&gt;, and vice versa. PunApps AP Comp Sci . In addition: . &lt; becomes &gt;= | &gt; becomes &lt;= | == becomes != | &lt;= becomes &gt; | &gt;= becomes &lt; | != becomes == | . For example: . !(!A || !B) --&gt; A &amp;&amp; B . As you can see, the ! in the front propogates and distributes into the condition, negating the ! inside as well as changing the || (or) to &amp;&amp; (and). If you plug in the values, you will see that they equate to the same thing. It may not make intuitive sense exactly, but it is a proven law. . Seen below is an example of this law: . import java.util.Scanner; public class DeMorgan { // define variables public static String email = null; public static String username = null; public static String password = null; // take the input for the variables using scanner public static String inputDetails(String detail) { System.out.print(detail + &quot;: &quot;); Scanner detailScan = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner initiate String inputDetail = detailScan.nextLine(); System.out.println(inputDetail); detailScan.close(); return inputDetail; // return the input } public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;type your email, username, then password to sign up: &quot;); // take user input email = inputDetails(&quot;email&quot;); username = inputDetails(&quot;username&quot;); password = inputDetails(&quot;password&quot;); // conditional, if not all requirements met then throw error if (!(email != &quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; username != &quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; password != &quot;&quot;)) { throw new Error(&quot;Not all requirements are met&quot;); } } } DeMorgan.main(null); . type your email, username, then password to sign up: email: f username: d password: . java.lang.Error: Not all requirements are met at DeMorgan.main(#13:1) at .(#35:1) . As seen, it takes user input and checks if all of them have some sort of input. If they do not, the NOT operator turns that false into true for the conditional, throwing the error. In essence, it is saying that NOT all conditions are met. . import java.util.Scanner; public class DeMorgan { // define variables public static String email = null; public static String username = null; public static String password = null; public static String inputDetails(String detail) { System.out.print(detail + &quot;: &quot;); Scanner detailScan = new Scanner(System.in); // scanner initiate String inputDetail = detailScan.nextLine(); System.out.println(inputDetail); detailScan.close(); return inputDetail; } // take the input for the variables using scanner public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;type your email, username, then password to sign up: &quot;); // take user input email = inputDetails(&quot;email&quot;); username = inputDetails(&quot;username&quot;); password = inputDetails(&quot;password&quot;); // conditional with de morgans law applied if (email == &quot;&quot; || username == &quot;&quot; || password == &quot;&quot;) { throw new Error(&quot;Not all requirements are met&quot;); } } } DeMorgan.main(null); . type your email, username, then password to sign up: email: f username: d password: . java.lang.Error: Not all requirements are met at DeMorgan.main(#13:1) at .(#30:1) . After applying De Morgan&#39;s law and switching all of the comparators, such as != to == and &amp;&amp; to ||, the code becomes much more readable. It reads that if any one of the inputs are not filled in, then the condition is true and the error is thrown. In essence: if any of the inputs are empty, throw an error. As seen, it has the same output, so it demonstrates that the law is true. . Inspiration from Patrick Divine .",

Project Description . In this project, I worked with Bailey to create this program. The code is split into 3 files: one to draw the graph, one to gather user input, and one to calculate the trajectory equation. The overall code structure flows like so: . initialize TrajectoryGraph object, and call the user input method | the user inputs the initial velocity, initial height, and initial degrees into a JOptionsPane | the data is fed into the calculator, which returns height given a x value | the graph is initialized, and drawn using Function2D | the graph is then presented to the user as a GUI element | . Key Requirements . Using Math . getRoot() . public double getRoot() { double rootOne = (-this.coefficientB + Math.sqrt(Math.pow(coefficientB, 2) - 4 * (-this.coefficientC) * this.coefficientA)) / (2 * (-this.coefficientC)); double rootTwo = (-this.coefficientB - Math.sqrt(Math.pow(coefficientB, 2) - 4 * (-this.coefficientC) * this.coefficientA)) / (2 * (-this.coefficientC)); if (rootOne &gt; 0) { return rootOne; } else if (rootTwo &gt; 0) { return rootTwo; } else { return 0.0; } } . In this section from the TrajectoryMath.java file, the Math class is used to calculate the quadratic formula. This can be seen with the Math.sqrt(Math.pow(coefficientB, 2) - 4 * (-this.coefficientC) * this.coefficientA)), which uses the class methods of square root and exponents. . calculateEquation() . private void calculateEquation() { this.coefficientA = height; this.coefficientB = Math.tan(degrees * Math.PI/180); this.coefficientC = 9.8 / (2 * Math.pow(velocity, 2) * Math.pow(Math.cos(degrees * Math.PI/180), 2)); String precheckedEquation = &quot;y = &quot; + String.valueOf(coefficientA) + &quot; + &quot; + String.valueOf(coefficientB) + &quot;x - &quot; + String.valueOf(coefficientC) + &quot;x^2&quot;; // Fix double negative, but later //if (precheckedEquation.contains(&quot;- -&quot;)) { //} //Add threshold this.equation = precheckedEquation; } . In this section from the TrajectoryMath.java file, the Math class is used again to calculate coefficientC, with both exponent and using the trig function of cosine. . Different Constructor Signatures . // TrajectoryGraph.java public TrajectoryGraph() { InputInitial newInputs = new InputInitial(); // start input object from separate file newInputs.spawnInputs(); // start the process of collecting user input drawGraph(InputInitial.initialVelocity, InputInitial.initialDegrees, InputInitial.initialHeight); // call method to draw the graph with the user input taken } // TrajectoryMath.java public TrajectoryMath(double velocity, double degrees, double height) { this.velocity = velocity; this.degrees = degrees; this.height = height; this.calculateEquation(); } . As seen above, these are two different constructors from different files. One of them initiates a graph object, while the other is used to calculate the function to display. . Wrapper Class + Static Data . // InputInitial.java public static Double initialVelocity; public static Double initialDegrees; public static Double initialHeight; . The wrapper class of Double defines the static data of the initialValues used in InputInitial. I used the wrapper class in order to be able to use the default null value to do error handling, as without being a wrapper class the double has to be a number. . Example Outputs: . . Organization . Working as a Team . To complete this, me and my partner Bailey Say split up the work in order to be more efficient. Bailey worked on creating the TrajectoryMath.java file, which took care of getting and setting the variables to create the function. It also created the function itself, and he did research to find the formula to calculate a trajectory. . As for myself, I worked on getting GUI to display as well as creating dialog boxes for the user to input. For this, I worked on the TrajectoryGraph.java as well as InputInitial.java. I also worked on error handling in input, cutting off negative inputs as well as non double inputs. . In addition to working on GUI, I also attempted to use spring boot and maven to build the project. Even though I could not exactly figure out how to put it on a website, I at least resolved issues with building through maven. I learned that the package in front of the files has to correspond with the specific folder in order for maven to know what to import, and that allowed us to use these multiple files to run a single program. . Conclusion . Overall, this project helped me and Bailey to understand more about how projects in Java are built, having to figure out how to use tools like maven. It also allowed us to experiment with multi file java programs, finding out how calling methods from other files works as well as classes. In addition to being good learning for CSA, it also contributes to me and Bailey&#39;s experience in AP Physics. .",

            "content": "Classes . Java classes are the basic building block, like a template for objects of the class. A class is defined in its own .java file, and the name of the file has to match with the class name. . . A class can contain data (variables) and actions (methods). It can also extend functionality of another parent class, which will be discussed later in this blog. . Instances of classes . The instance of a class is an object. It is defined in it’s own java file, where attributes for the object instance can be set as well as methods for the object. . To instance a class as an object, first type the class name, then the object name, equals new class();. . . As seen in the image above, the Painter class has been instanced, and the Painter object was defined in a separate file. . Object Calling Methods . The class definition probably contains some sort of methods for the object, when instanced, to do. To call a function, first write the object instance name, a period, and then the method called. . For example: . Reader reader1 = new Reader(); // initiates new reader class instance called reader1 reader1.checkOutBook(bookName); // calls method checkOutBook with a given name . . As seen above, the object myPainter is also calling a method: move(). . Calling methods is extremely common in the realm of Java programming, and often takes on other actions like doing math calculations or displaying text. . Object Mutating Data . An object mutating data means that the object changes some sort of data. From last week, it can change the primitive data types plus the wrapper classes. However, it can also change the state of an object. This is not always a good thing, as it could change or break the program as well as increase memory usage. . Objects are reference type data. So, if you set another variable equal to that object and change some parameters, it automatically affects the original. . Sometimes that is what you want, changing the value of the object itself rather than having to make another object. . For example, the String object is immutable. To change the string, a new string object must be created: . String a = &quot;code code&quot; a = a.concat(&quot; code&quot;) // has to make new string a again instead of just appending . StringBuilder is mutable, so the methods can just change the object . StringBuilder a = new StringBuilder(&quot;code code&quot;) a.append(&quot; code&quot;) // has to make new string a again instead of just appending . Extends . As the name suggests, extends in java “extends” a class. The class created is inherited from another class, but more methods can be written in addition to the methods already in the original class. The attributes are also inherited. . The subclass is the class that inherits, while the superclass is the class being inherited from. . To extend, simply put extends and then the superclass. . super can also be used to refer to the superclass objects. Inside the class itself, super(); can be called in order to inherit all the original methods and attributes. . . As seen above, the PainterPlus class extends the Painter class, inheriting the attributes and methods with super. There is then a new method to turn right, being: . public void turnRight() { this.turnLeft(); this.turnLeft(); this.turnLeft(); } . This can then be called in the main function by initializing a PainterPlus instance, and calling the method to turnRight like so: . PainterPlus myPainterPlus = new PainterPlus(); myPainterPlus.turnRight(); . This can be taken further with more sophisticated methods. . Loops and Selection Statements . Like most programming languages, java also has while and if statements. . In a while loop, as long as the condition is true, the code will continue repeating until it is false. . . This snippet of code uses a while loop so when the painter is on the bucket, it will take the paint until there is no more bucket. . As for if statements, it usually comes in a pair of if and else. If the condition is met, some code will run. If not, then the code under the else block will run instead. It reads like english. . . This one combines both while and if. While the painter can move, and isn’t on a bucket, the painter will move. If it is not on a bucket, it will take paint, but once it cannot move, it will stop. . Final Product of Code.org . . Eventually, all these elements were combined to form a pattern in Lesson 14. A new class PatternPainter was created that extends Painter, and has methods to paint a checkerboard. The BackgroundPainter class was also created to extend Painter, and paint over any non-painted tiles. Finally, these were put together to form the final product. . Console vs GUI vs Code.org . There are many ways to interface with code, these three are all ways to do that. . With console, the inputs and outputs of the program are mainly done through text. In other words, it’s like typing into a text terminal to get things done. An example of this is Mr Morts console menu that allows users to choose some output to display. . With GUI, the inputs and outputs are not displayed as text in a terminal, but instead is usually displayed as a window. This could be better for users to interface with, as the display is more clear. However, it may be more complicated to program. . With code.org, it is basically a specialized IDE. The classes and methods such as the Painter interface directly with the output, which is a canvas with a painter painting. The code that is in the files doesn’t exactly show the behind the scenes drawing, but instead provides an easier way to interface with that output such as with turnLeft() just turning left. . Overall, console menus are used more for backend development and testing, GUI for the end user, and code.org just for learning. .",

            "content": "Develop an understanding of the following concepts. Your understanding will be fuller if you go beyond definitions. Take notes as you develop this understanding. You may want to organize your notes in a chart with columns for definitions, examples and typical rhetorical effects, where applicable . Diction . Word Definition Examples Typical Rhetorical Effects . High/formal | Where sophisticated language is used, without slang or colloquialism . Complex syntax of sentence, usually in business doc . | . | “Thank you for accepting me into your institution. It would be an honor to attend and participate in this prestigious event.” | Usually makes author sound intelligent, appeals to the audience’s intelligence .

            "title": "APCSA Week 1 Learning Log",
            "content": "Weekly Activities . This week in CSA, I reviewed concepts of bash as well as commands in bash that could help check versions and the installation of tools. I also refreshed my knowledge of the conditional statement in bash, like if statements, overall helping me review programming logic. . In addition to bash, I also learned basic Java syntax and programming through code.org. A class in java is like a template for objects, and there are objects that are created from the class. These objects can have methods (that execute code), and attributes. . This java learning was further enhanced by learning about primitive data types, and I did extra research on the wrapper classes as well. I then made a program to convert between SI units, using these primitive data types as well as utilizing the methods in OOP. . Plans for the Future of This Class . As we will be learning the 10 collegeboard units, I will capture this information by making a post for each, organizing them by the number as well as tagging them. I will put their links as I go along into the notes section of the website, so I don’t lose track. . . I will also blog my weekly adventures in this class as to better remember the course material I have reviewed. For example, this blog itself is helping to consolidate my knowledge of java and bash already. . Finally, I will tag all posts with the appropriate learning, with the collegeboard units once we start or the PBL learning. .",

Integer wraps int | Byte wraps byte | Short wraps short | Long wraps long | Float wraps float | Double wraps double | Boolean wraps boolean | Character wraps char | . Wrapper classes are used when working with collections, or putting the data into an ArrayList or other data structures.

Filtering Commands . grep is a very useful command in linux, used to filter content inside files to find a specific match. grep can also be used to find a match in the output of a command. . grep &quot;the&quot; README.md # searches for and prints any matches of &quot;read&quot; in readme file grep -rl &quot;read&quot; $project # searches recursively through project directory for &quot;read&quot; while only listing filenames . find is a command similar to grep, but it matches filenames instead of the contents instead files or from outputs like grep does. . echo &quot;README files&quot; find $project -iname *README* # finds files in the project directory that have readme in the name echo &quot;&quot; echo &quot;jupyter notebook files&quot; find $project -iname *.ipynb # finds files in the project directory that have md as the file extension . Miscellaneous Commands . &quot;env&quot; shows environmental variables set in shell | &quot;sort&quot; sorts the output or contents of a file (can set specific flags) | &quot;head&quot;/&quot;tail&quot; outputs the first or last lines of a file | . Hacks . Possible bash automations: . Verifying Installation of Tools . This is a simple bash script (a file with .sh file extension) that checks if a package is installed and installs it based on user input. . while true; do read -r -p &quot;would you like to choose a package to check? [y/n] &quot; option # asks and reads input of user if they want to see if package is installed case $option in # uses input to see the results y) read -p &quot;Enter package to check: &quot; tools_verify # reads input for specific package if [[ $(apt list --installed $tools_verify 2&gt;/dev/null | tail -1) = *installed* ]]; then # checks if the tool is installed version_number=$(apt list --installed $tools_verify 2&gt;/dev/null | tail -1 | cut -d &quot; &quot; -f 2) # finds the version number echo &quot;$tools_verify is installed! The version number is $version_number.&quot; echo &quot;&quot; else while true; do read -r -p &quot;$tools_verify is not installed! Would you like to install? [y/n] &quot; install_option case $install_option in y) sudo apt-get install -y $tools_verify # installs the package version_number=$(apt list --installed $tools_verify 2&gt;/dev/null | tail -1 | cut -d &quot; &quot; -f 2) # finds the version number echo &quot;$tools_verify is installed! The version number is $version_number.&quot; echo &quot;&quot; break # returns back to main loop of package to check ;; n) echo &quot;alright then!&quot; break # returns back to main loop ;; *) echo &quot;Invalid Option&quot; ;; esac done fi ;; n) echo &quot;see you next time!&quot; break # ends the script ;; *) echo &quot;Invalid Option&quot; # throws user back to start of script ;; esac done . would you like to choose a package to check? [y/n] . Anaconda Verify Installation . if [[ $(conda --version) ]]; then condaversion=$(conda --version) echo &quot;$condaversion is installed!&quot; else echo &quot;Anaconda not installed!&quot; fi . conda 4.14.0 is installed! . Conda Verifiying Packages Installed . This code snippet checks if a package in conda is installed, and if not, installs it. . export conda_package=jupyter # can be any package if [[ $(conda list $conda_package | grep -w jupyter) = *$conda_package* ]]; then # matches package with list of installed packageversion=$(conda list $conda_package | grep -w jupyter | awk &#39;{print $2}&#39;) echo &quot;$conda_package is already installed! It&#39;s version is $packageversion.&quot; else echo &quot;$conda_package has not been installed, installing now.&quot; conda install $conda_package fi . jupyter is already installed! It&#39;s version is 1.0.0. . Java Verify Installation . if [[ $(java --version) ]]; then jdkversion=$(java --version | head -n 1) echo &quot;$jdkversion is installed!&quot; else echo &quot;Java not installed!&quot; fi # java compiler version check if [[ $(javac --version) ]]; then jcompilerversion=$(javac --version | head -n 1) echo &quot;$jcompilerversion is installed!&quot; else echo &quot;JavaC not installed!&quot; fi . openjdk 17.0.4 2022-07-19 is installed! javac 17.0.4 is installed! . Updating Repositories . export repository=blog # sets the repository to a specific one export repo_main_folder=vscode # where the repositories are stored cd $HOME/$repo_main_folder/$blog # moves into that directory git fetch origin # fetches any changes git pull origin master # updates the repo with new changes .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
