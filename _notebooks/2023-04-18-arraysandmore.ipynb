    "An array can contain primitives (int, char, etc) and object references of a class. Primitive data types have their actual values stored in contiguous memory  location. They are useful when you need to store a large number of values of the same type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays can also be used to store objects of a class. In this case, the array stores the reference to the object.\n",

    "Important things to note are that:\n",
    "- Arrays are fixed in size\n",
    "- They are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0 not 1\n",
    "- Arrays can be used as a static field, local variable, or method parameter\n",
