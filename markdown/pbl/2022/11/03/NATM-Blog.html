<p>The first project I went to see was this group’s website, which was fastpages that had one page of rating what chance you had to get into college. I even tried it out, adding my grades and amount of extracurriculars. I got a really low score though, and I had to reload the page to even see the score. Overall, it was an interesting and humorous project.</p>

<p>After finishing our CS presentation, my friends and I went exploring around the school. The first thing we found was the digital art projects:</p>

<p>Then, we went to ceramics to check out their projects.</p>

<p>I checked out my friend’s pottery, which had a really interesting octopus mug.</p>

<p>Finally, we checked out the AP studio art.</p>

<p>They had some really cool black and white drawings, and the photography collage section was really interesting too.</p>

<h1 id="back-to-cs">
<a class="anchor" href="#back-to-cs" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>back to cs</h1>
<p>At last, we went back to CS and checked out people’s other projects.</p>

<p>We checked out Rohan’s statistics project, which had some interesting characteristics of being able to store data. The data could be displayed in box plots and scatter plots, very cool.</p>

<p>That concludes our experience!!!</p>
