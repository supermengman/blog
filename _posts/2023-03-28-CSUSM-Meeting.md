# CSUSM Extra Credit

- two recent graduates (applied physics and smth)

## Ashley
    - work in quantum mechanics
    - took ap physics, loved it
    - CSU one of the only CSU with physics major
    - first gen student, failed a lot in calc
    - got into research, and is now getting a phd in material sciences
    - SM good campus to learn more

## John

- started at palomar
- 2 associates in physics and comp sci
- inteeresting because hasn't actually been on campus until last semester
- 6 yrs to get graduate degree
- comp sci is a versatile degree, every field uses it

# info abt sm

- newest cal state
- poultry farm originally
- new tutoring center recently
- national leader in social mobility
    - turnover of socioecon status to graduate
    - lots of internships with local industries (qualcomm, general atomics, etc)
- a lot of stairs

# Pathways

- computer science:
    - cybersecurity, computer engineer, EE, software engineering
- constantly changing curriculum to adapt 
- can also transition classes without falling behind

# Clubs

- Cybersecurity, robotics, 3D printing, Society of Physics Students, etc

# Internship

- give good work experience
- find them by joining clubs
    - or maybe going to campus events 
    - google to find oppurtunities
    - check email 
- try to avoid unpaid internships in college
    - ask people to help write essays too

# programs

- summer scholars program: do research with advisor
    - get paid too (6k)
- admitted students : QUantum Bridge Program

## Research

- materials research
- quantum research
- meteroite research

# Paying for College

- grant v scholarship: grant is government give, scholarship is privately give
- have to find scholarships yourself
- if turn 18 before, report own income to get more scholarship/financial aid
- 2 loans: subsidized, unsubsidized
    - subsidized: gov help, prevent further debt with less/no interest
    - unsubsidized loan: does accrue interest
- apply for FAFSA, studentaid.gov
- possibly go to community first to avoid debt

# Life after College

- may pay to get masters degrees (companies)
- also get internships to get a job

# Upcoming events

- mostly for admitted students, but there is Cougar Blue Day
