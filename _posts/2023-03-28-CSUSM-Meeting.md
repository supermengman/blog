# CSUSM Interest Meeting

- two recent graduates (applied physics and smth)

## Ashley
    - work in quantum mechanics
    - took ap physics, loved it
    - CSU one of the only CSU with physics major
    - first gen student, failed a lot in calc
    - got into research, and is now getting a phd in material sciences
    - SM good campus to learn more

## John

- started at palomar
- 2 associates in physics and comp sci
- inteeresting because hasn't actually been on campus until last semester
- 6 yrs to get graduate degree
- comp sci is a versatile degree, every field uses it

# info abt sm

- newest cal state
- poultry farm originally
- new tutoring center recently
- national leader in social mobility
    - turnover of socioecon status to graduate
    - lots of internships with local industries (qualcomm, general atomics, etc)
- a lot of stairs

# Pathways

- computer science:
    - cybersecurity, computer engineer, EE, software engineering
- constantly changing curriculum to adapt 
- can also transition classes without falling behind

## contact


# Clubs

- Cybersecurity, robotics, 3D printing, Society of Physics Students, etc

# Internship

- give good work experience
- find them by joining clubs
    - or maybe going to campus events 
    - google to find oppurtunities
    - check email 
- try to avoid unpaid internships in college
    - ask people to help write essays too

# programs

- summer scholars program: do research with advisor
    - get paid too (6k)
- admitted students : QUantum Bridge Program

## Research

- materials research
- quantum research
- meteroite research

# Paying for College

- grant v scholarship: grant is government give, scholarship is privately give
- have to find scholarships yourself
- if turn 18 before, report own income to get more scholarship/financial aid
- 2 loans: subsidized, unsubsidized
    - subsidized: gov help, prevent further debt with less/no interest
    - unsubsidized loan: does accrue interest
- apply for FAFSA, studentaid.gov
- possibly go to community first to avoid debt

# Life after College

- may pay to get masters degrees (companies)
- also get internships to get a job

# Upcoming events

- mostly for admitted students, but there is Cougar Blue Day

# Reflection

As this the first time I've actually been to a college meeting at school, it was truly a beneficial experience. The information they gave about applying to college was helpful not only to apply for CSU, but also for college in general. For example, I didn't know that you had to apply for scholarships separately, and that subsidized loans were a much better choice than unsubsidized. With such helpful life advice, I can't help but be extremely thankful for their time and effort. Specifically about San Marcos, I also realized that they had many STEM programs and focuses on curriculum that larger schools can't do. With clubs such as cybersecurity club and robotics club, they piqued my interest. Now, CSUSM is definitely a school I would consider applying to. The small campus, the research oppurtunities, and internship oppurtunities are all things that I would love to experience. Overall, I am very grateful for the time they took to come to our school and give us such helpful information.
