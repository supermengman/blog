# Weekly Activities

This week in CSA, I completed code.org Unit 1, which consisted of learning about java object orientated program. To find out what I fully learned, check out my post: [Code.org Unit 1](https://supermengman.github.io/blog/markdown/code.org/collegeboard/2022/09/04/Unit-1-Code-org.html)

In addition, I also used this knowledge of object orientated programming as well as using the math class to create a trajectory calculator. I collaborated on this with Bailey, which allowed me to have a better understanding of how collaborative programming works. Check out the full details here: [Trajectory Calculator](https://supermengman.github.io/blog/jupyter/java/pbl/2022/09/05/Using-Objects.html)

# Extras

In addition to doing these programs, I continued to organize my posts through tags. I added the trajectory calculator link to the PBL section, and the Code.org into the Collegeboard learning section for easier reference later. Find them here: [Notes](https://supermengman.github.io/blog/notes/)
