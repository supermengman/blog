# CS Project: College Admission Score
![](../images/natm/IMG_5313.png)

The first project I went to see was this group's website, which was fastpages that had one page of rating what chance you had to get into college. I even tried it out, adding my grades and amount of extracurriculars. I got a really low score though, and I had to reload the page to even see the score. Overall, it was an interesting and humorous project.
